Solidity Smart Contracts
This repository contains a collection of Solidity smart contracts that are designed to be run on Remix, an online solidity compiler and runtime environment. The contracts cover a variety of topics, including token creation, voting systems, and decentralized autonomous organizations.

Getting Started
To run these contracts on Remix, simply copy and paste the code into the Remix editor and deploy the contract to the Ethereum network of your choice. You may need to adjust the contract parameters and variables to suit your specific use case.
